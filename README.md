# TuneStream

![TuneStream bot icon](assets/bot-icon.png)

TuneStream is one node in the 13-bot Discord music fleet. A dedicated always-on stream of queued tracks. It owns its queue tables, reports playback state to the shared swarm database, and is controlled directly from Discord, Aria, and SwarmPanel.

## Identity

- Discord display name: **GWS Music Bot (TuneStream)**
- Internal node name: `tunestream`
- Command namespace: `/tunestream_main_*`

## What It Does

- Plays links, playlists, search results, and livestreams through Lavalink, picking the best available audio quality.
- Persists the live queue, backup queue, current track, requester, playtime, and recovery state to MySQL.
- Restores playback automatically from database state after disconnects, restarts, or voice connection stalls.
- Uses smooth fade logic with many small volume steps instead of a low-volume pause followed by a jump, with optional "smart" fade timing based on track length and active filters.
- Applies audio filters (nightcore, vaporwave, bass boost, and more) by replacing active filters instead of stacking them.
- Supports temporary per-track speed/pitch modifiers that automatically expire after a set number of tracks.
- Keeps auto-shuffle from placing duplicate tracks next to each other when avoidable.
- Runs a Smart Auto-DJ layer that learns server and per-user taste from likes, dislikes, and playback history, and can queue recommendations when the queue runs dry.
- Lets users save, list, load, and delete personal playlists, save the current queue as a playlist, and "steal" tracks from another listener's history.
- Tracks per-server leaderboards and play history, and can grab the currently playing track via DM.
- Cleans local, pre-cache, and Lavalink-adjacent cache state on the built-in 10-hour maintenance timer.
- Reports heartbeat, queue depth, backup depth, track state, and errors for Aria and SwarmPanel.

## Fleet Role

- Node: `tunestream`
- Database schema: `discord_music_tunestream`
- Panel visibility: SwarmPanel bot dashboard, queue controls, recovery views, and health feed.
- Aria visibility: Medic drift checks, voice timeout triage, stale node checks, and recovery probes.

## Tech Stack

- [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) 2.7
- [Wavelink](https://github.com/PythonistaGuild/Wavelink) 3.5 + a shared Lavalink node (youtube, lavasrc, sponsorblock plugins)
- aiomysql against the shared swarm MySQL/MariaDB instance
- Dockerized via the fleet's `docker-compose.yml`, with persistent log and cache volumes

## Guardrails

- Owner-only command access keeps the bot private.
- Cookie jars, tokens, and environment secrets are ignored and should never be committed.
- Queue recovery prefers the persisted live queue first, then the backup queue when the live queue leaks or fails.
